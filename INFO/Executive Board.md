The Executive board is made up of these eight positions:
- [[President]]
- [[Treasurer]]
- [[Vice President]]
- [[House Manager]]
- [[Phikeia Educator]]
- [[Recruitment]]
- [[Scholarship]]
- [[Risk Management]]

Though each of the officers listed above have their own responsibilities, they are also a part of the executive committee.
The executive committee is in charge of running the operations of the chapter - making sure that officers get their respective duties done and in general leading the chapter. They hold weekly meetings chaired by the [[Vice President]]. Votes for their meetings will exclude the [[President]] unless his vote is required for a tie-breaker.
