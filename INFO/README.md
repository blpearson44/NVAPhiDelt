# Readme
## What is this?
This is a wiki made for the Phi Delt Theta Nevada Alpha chapter to replace (or come as close as possible to replacing) the outdated officer binders. This was originally made in an application called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). This wiki can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/blpearson44/NVAPhiDelt). 
## How do I use it?
Like a normal Wiki, the primary method of navigation is going to be links. It can also be navigated in a folder-like structure depending on how it is being viewed. The folders separate the roles into "binders" but they still will have a connection if there is one to be made.
## How do I edit it?
To edit this, simply clone the repo that I gave above and edit the source code however you want - the beauty of this is that this original version will remain untouched, so feel free to really mess around with it if you want. However, because it is a public repo some things will not be up here - so also be careful with your repos.
## Where do I get started?
