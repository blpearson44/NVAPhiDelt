# President
## Description
The President of the chapter is one of the jobs with the highest workload and the most responsibility. Often times the President is called the "face of the chapter" and this is true - whether it be for better or worse. It is important that whoever assumes this role understand the level of responsibility. If things go awry *that could have been prevented* then the President is likely the one who will be punished for it. You will be the person that media or the school will reach out to with questions or issues. But you will also be the first person people associate your fraternity with. 

In terms of what you actually do, mostly you keep the chapter organized and on top of stuff - filling out forms, attending events, running meeting. Besides that, it is up to you to do what you can to help make your chapter great. Help out with other positions, keep them on top of their responsibilities, make sure no one is embezzling money (did I mention that as President **you will be on the chapter bank account**?), and in general keep the chapter afloat.

## Duties
From the bylaws:
- He must attend or send a representative to all Alumni luncheons.

## Transition
I have never held this position, so this section will have to grow over time.
