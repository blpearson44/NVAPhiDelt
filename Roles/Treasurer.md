# Treasurer
## Description
Some call it the messiah, others call it "literally the only reason the chapter has not self destructed," but frankly the work that the Treasurer does is not that challenging. This role has the highest level of responsibility behind only the [[President]]. Though you have a similar workload, it tends to be a rather regular set of issues as long as you stay on top of work - the really challenging part is after the chapter finances have fallen apart for years and you have to rebuild it from scratch (not fun trust me). 

Aside from being on the [[Executive Board]] the Treasurer holds nearly every financial responsibility in the chapter. This is a lot, which is why the [[Finance Committee]] was created in order to help out. The Treasurer is also on the chapter bank account like the [[President]].

	- This involves learning and using the billing system

	- You need to be on the bank account for this
